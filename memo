I was visiting Singapore 2 years ago, and this was my first trip to foreign country by myself. The reason I chose Singapore as my first trip destination are so simple. it was said that Singapore was safest country and one of the most attractive country in Asia. I did not want to choose dangerous country for my first travel. Through this blog, I want to tell you about my trip and how you will be able to have good time there.

Day 1
I arrived airport at 16.pm, and went to airport train station immediately. Firstly, I was heading to Marina Bay Sands that is iconic landmark in Singapore. I was just surprised at that building, because that was bigger than I thought. There were also huge shopping mall around that, but I did not buy anything then. I think I just wanted to eat something at first, and I was heading to chinatown to eat dinner. There are a thousands of restaurants there, but I chose hookers to eat chicken rice. It only cost 5 dollars and drank fruits juice at 1 dollars. It was little spicy, but really tasty.
